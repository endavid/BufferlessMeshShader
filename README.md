# Bufferless Mesh Shader

Example that tries to reproduce an issue I got with the depth buffer when playing with Mesh Shaders.

Some screenshots and a video in this thread: [@endavid](https://x.com/endavid/status/1749413903438672028?s=20)

I was trying to create something for #Genuary while practicing mesh shaders, and then I got stuck with the depth buffer. It seems it's acting funny.
